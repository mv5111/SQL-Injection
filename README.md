# SQL-Injection

Web applications are ubiquitous in the digital landscape, facilitating many services and interactions. However, their widespread use also exposes them to potential security vulnerabilities, with SQL injection standing out as a persistent and critical threat. This project endeavours to comprehensively explore the practical application of the SQLMAP penetration testing tool to identify, exploit, and address SQL injection vulnerabilities within a controlled environment.

Objective: This project begins with an in-depth exploration of SQL injection, elucidating the mechanics of this attack vector. It delves into how malicious actors manipulate user inputs to execute unauthorized SQL queries, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of databases.

Lab Setup and Simulation: Leveraging Kali Linux as the chosen operating system, deliberately vulnerable web application (http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php) is employed to simulate real-world scenarios. The controlled environment ensures ethical testing while allowing for hands-on exploration of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
 
Step-by-Step Demonstration with SQLMAP: The project meticulously guides users through the SQLMAP tool, providing detailed explanations of essential commands and parameters. Noteworthy aspects include the-u parameter for specifying the target URL,--dbs for listing available databases,-D for selecting a specific database,--tables for listing tables within a database, and--dump for extracting data from columns. Special emphasis is given to the Acunetix vulnerability testing site (http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php).
 
This project holds significant value for a diverse audience, including developers, security professionals, and ethical hackers. Its detailed exploration of SQL injection vulnerabilities and hands-on demonstrations with SQLMAP contribute practical insights to the ongoing discourse on web application security. By combining theoretical knowledge with actionable steps, the project aims to empower stakeholders with the skills and awareness needed to fortify web applications against SQL injection and related threats.
